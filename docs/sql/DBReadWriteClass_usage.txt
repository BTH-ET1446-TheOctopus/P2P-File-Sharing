Path to DBReadWriteClass.java and DBMain.java:
~\p2p\src\Bootstrap\src\test\java\sql
~\p2p\src\client\src\test\java\sql

"DBReadWriteClass.java" tries to "write to" and "read from" the database and show it in the output;

In this initial file we first write some sample data into "serverpeers" table and read these data from it and show it in console.

How to use it in your machine:
1. one can create a separate project in Eclipse, import these two files (DBReadWriteClass.java, DBMain.java) into the project's package.

2. first comment out the DBMain.java file

3. Run the project normally; You should get some info in the console.

4. When we run the project, we actually put these samples into the table in the database, so we should then delete them, because this is just a test and we don't want to mess up our database. So use "truncate serverpeers" in command line to delete these sample data.
- Be careful about command "truncate"; Never use it in real world, unless you know what you're doing!
- It is a good approach if first make a back up of the db, before any testing.
- for each run of the test, first delete previous data;


NOTICE:
a) It's assumed you installed mysql in your machine correctly and also bind sql connector/J to your Eclipse. (Google it in case you don't setup these yet.)
b) Database URL is defined in "connectionUrl" value.
You should adopt the username and password for sql running in your own machine.
