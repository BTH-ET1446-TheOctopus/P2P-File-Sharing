Path to DBReadWrite:
~\p2p\src\Bootstrap\src\main\java\sql
~\p2p\src\client\src\main\java\sql

DBReadWrite file tries to retrieve information from the database and show it in the output;

In this initial file we retrieve some data from "serverpeers" table as follow: "File ID", "Latest IP" and "Black List".

How to use it in your machine:
1. one can create a separate project in Eclipse, import these two files (DBReadWrite.java, ToReadDB.java) into the project's package.

2. first comment out the ToReadDB.java file

3. Run the project normally; You should get some info from those columns mentioned above (If you put some data in them).

NOTICE:
a) It's assumed you installed mysql in your machine correctly and also bind sql connector/J to your Eclipse. (Google it in case you don't setup these yet.)
b) Database URL is defined in "connectionUrl" value.
You should adopt the username and password for sql running in your own machine.
